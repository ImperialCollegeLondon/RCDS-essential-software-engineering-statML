    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which can run on your computer, or remotely, such as in a GitHub codespace. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes. As such, it is a powerful and popular tool for writing code."

    "One of the key features of VS Code is the Marketplace. This is a collection of extensions that can be installed to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. You can access the Marketplace by clicking on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar on the left or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. If you're looking at these notes on a Codespace, there should already be some extensions installed.\n",

Typically, you will open a fodler that contains a project you're working on by clicking on the \"Open Folder\" button on the welcome screen or by selecting \"File\" -> \"Open Folder\" from the menu."

    "\n",
    "* Create a `.py` file in the Explorer view by right-clicking on the folder and selecting \"New File\". Name it `hello.py`.\n",
    "* Start typing `print`. You will see a dropdown window with suggestions. You can press tab to select and insert the top suggestion, or scroll through them with the arrow keys. This is called autocompletion. \n",
    "* Complete the line with `print(\"Hello, World!\")`.\n",
    "* Hover over the `print` function. You will see a popup with information about the function. This is known as intelli-sense in VS Code. It can be a quick way to get information on the functions you are using.\n",
    "* Note the different colours of the text. This is called syntax highlighting. It can help you to quickly identify different parts of your code.\n",
    "* Write another print statement `print((1 + 2) * 3)`. Note, as you create open brackets, VS Code automatically creates the closed brackets.\n",
    "* Note the brackets are colour-coded to help spot which brackets match.\n",
    "* Delete the bracket after the 2. Note the squiggly lines which appears, letting you know there is an error. Hover over the squiggly line to see a brief error message.\n",
    "* At the top-right of the window click the \"Play\" button. Observe the output of the code in the terminal.\n",
    "* The terminal is a convenient place to access the command line in your OS. You can run commands here, such as `python hello.py` to run your Python program."
